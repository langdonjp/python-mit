PROBLEM 1: PAYING THE MINIMUM
Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

The following variables contain values as described below:

balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card

annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal

For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance, and print to screen something of the format:

Month: 1
Minimum monthly payment: 96.0
Remaining balance: 4784.0
Be sure to print out no more than two decimal digits of accuracy - so print

Remaining balance: 813.41
instead of

Remaining balance: 813.4141998135 
Finally, print out the total amount paid that year and the remaining balance at the end of the year in the format:

Total paid: 96.0
Remaining balance: 4784.0
"""

month = 0
totalPay = 0
monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 12.0
while month <12:
    minPay = monthlyPaymentRate * balance
    unpayBal = balance - minPay
    totalPay += minPay
    balance = unpayBal + (monthlyInterestRate * unpayBal)
    month += 1
    print('Month: ' + str(month))
    print('Minimum monthly payment: ' + str(round(minPay,2)))
    print('Remaining balance: ' + str(round(balance,2)))
print('Total paid: ' + str(round(totalPay,2)))
print(' Remaining balance: ' + str(round(balance,2)))
